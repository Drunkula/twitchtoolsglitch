Cooldowns mean you won't get alerts for every message and you can set timeouts any time at the click of a button.<a class="tag is-success is-small ml-3" href="chat-alert.html">Try it here.</a></div>

          <div class="block">A little more complicated than the other tools as you'll need to install OBS Websockets - which you might already be using if if you're using tools like Touch Portal or Lioranboard.</div>

          <div class="block">After you've created a panel you can send a link to the panel page that'll be valid only for 6 hours, or you can enable panels for longer and revoke its use as any time.</div>

          <div class="block">I've already implemented most of them but I want to tart them up for the website and create micro-versions for using in OBS custom docks.  And I'll have to make this entire thing look like less of a mess.</div>

This means you can download all or any of the tools and use them locally.  You won't even need a local web server.  You can edit the config files to add the channel(s) to load by default and set preferences on who can use use custom commands.</div>
          <div class="block">All tools can be limited to just your use as broadcaster or extend them with checkboxes to mods, vips or everyone.  Use can even be limited to those named only where appropriate.</div>
