Alternate commands for different players

In the URL
&cmdreplace=next:bnext,prev:bprev

Thing is chat commands are actually sent as chatprev, chatnext.  I could trim them off but maybe that's an advantage

nan should be redefined, too.  Yeah, I changed it to chatnan.  Only commands starting chat can be redefined.


Some chat commands are easy to replace as if the command doesn't exist you just
pass it along with the raw input e.g. you get
!bnext you ship that out and players check the action bnext which will have been next renamed

!add in chat has got to perform a grab then send a chunk of data with action="chatadd"

if we wanted to use !badd instead we've got to map add to badd (easy) but then map to a different sent command

!add|!badd|newchatadd

I suppose we could add a commandused="..." but !add also uses !sr and !songrequest

Add a command="!bim" to the package and check for that.

NEEDED : alias map in SB
    triggercommand in package
