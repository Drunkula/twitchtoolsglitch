This was a command pack:

it said the message was:
"Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"

But in the params

text: tiki tiki tiki says Iâ€™ve got Asda egg fried rice & chicken balls in the fridge lol

Actually loads of the command packs are borked


I found two entries DIFFERENT in the queue but both said the same 356 line:

355 THE CAT THE CAT
356 thomascerveaux says I meant the cat, yeah


PACKS COME IN WITH
pitch, rate, text, voice


FLOW on.message creates

    sayCmdPack {
        command: command reference e.g. "!tr" or "!all-chat",
        message: the incoming message unaltered

        params: {
            rate:
            pitch:
            voice: Object,
            text: run through add_speech_before_after(message, userstate, channel);
        }
    }

    Then ONLY the params are passed to speech.say(...)

    TTSVars.sayCmds is the source of the problem.  .text property gets added and WRITTEN BACK TO it
