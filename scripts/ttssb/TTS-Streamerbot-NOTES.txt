Handling emotes is much harder as their position isn't explicit

Ok - let's say we want multiple browsers, Edge and Chrome

Nickname, voice (name, pitch, rate, browser)

MESSAGE IN:
    * broadcast to all connected for DISPLAY ONLY.  Highlight colours for ones you'll say.
    * Queued in SB for speaking

SPEECH OUT
    * Sent to all connected with a flag of which browser type it's for

BROWSERS
    ON SPEECH
    * send END message with id of the message
    * send START message with the id of the message.  SB can start a timer in case of stalls

    ON CONNECT
    * SEND Type of browser
    * RECEIVES: users, nicknames, banned, permissions, user assigned voices, default voice, say before, say after,

    MESSAGES TO:
        speakmessage, movemessagetoold, addmessage, deletemessage,


SB NEEDED
    * List of connected browsers and if the browser needed for a voice is available
    * Not available then change to a browser that is


WHICH BROWSER DOES WHAT?

    I could do ?id=EDGE | ?id=CHROME rather than autodetecting.  Edge is easy to detect

    Browser SENDS voices on connect GETS browserID
        SB checks if that browser handles saved voices

        Dictionary<voiceURI, browserID>


        VOICE SELECT: Browser > Language > Voice

        If multiple browsers handle the same voice the 2nd one is ignored meaning multipled loads from same browser can be ignored

        If no browser is connected with the default voice a "Play generic" command will be sent to a connected browser.
